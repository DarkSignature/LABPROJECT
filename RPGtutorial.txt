You did it! Now, this is the battle tutorial...

As like any other battles in games, you need to pick an option

between Attack, Kraft, Defend, and Item Bag...

You probably know what the other does...

But what is a Kraft exactly?

It is a skill based on the class you chose!

It uses a special energy, so use it wisely!

Now onto the battle!
